# FizzBuzz
FizzBuzz problem in C#, JS, PHP and Python.

I was boring so i did a <strong>FizzBuzz</strong> problem in all the languages that I'm currently using. The big reason why i did this is that i recently read this <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/">article</a> and i wanted to know how much time would take me to do it.

By the way, it took me like 20 sec.
